<p> Read all of this to understand the concept of gambling</p>
<h>You won't make profit on gambling nor even dream of making a living on it if you keep betting more than 3 matches.<br>I was once in this list three years ago and now I'm happy to share my experience and the reason I think sometimes reading from experts on the sport really matter.<br>when I started betting, I use to bet 5 matches above hopping to make money at the end an sometimes I even borrow money thinking I will succeed that day and everything keep getting worst day after day.<br></h>
<h1>what make me become this good</h1>
<p> My favourite website have always been sofascore cause it give me every single player stat in every encounter there play an we should be thankful to them. Soccerway has also been helping me figure out the referees,top scorers and top assist in the sport.</p>
<p2>I spend about 1hour predicting a single game now following each an every single player stats in the last four matches there have played taking note of any important player if he is injured or will not play for some reason and this have really been boosting my success on this sport and sharing this to you really matters.<br> when you bet, you take note of the important players especially the tackling midfielders and if a yellow card is been giving to this type of players, expect to see that team receive a goal most often when the top guy got yellow carded in the first half. Your can verify what happen when casimero get yellow carded earlier in real Madrid fixtures.<br> predicting one or 2 matches will help you concentrate more on the fixtures leading to more success as compared to betting on five matches.<br> wagering $50 to win $75 at odd of 1.50(one match) is batter than wagering $10 hopping to win $500 at odd 50.00(8 matches).<br> After your predict your matches, stay up to date with the lineups. Most of them are available in most websites when it's 1hour or 30min to the match.<br>
